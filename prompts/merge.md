The problem below was decomposed into sub-problems. The sub-problems and their sub-solutions are provided in bullet points below the problem. Your task is to solve the problem with the help of the sub-solutions. Often, obtaining the final solution to the problem only requires you to apply a transformation to the sub-solutions. If you find any mistakes in the sub-solutions, you can fix the mistakes while you merge the sub-solutions.

You must reason about how to merge the sub-solutions and solve the problem before stating your final answer. The final answer MUST be between the following tags: <ANSWER>...</ANSWER>. Some examples are provided to showcase how to use the tags and to illustrate some merging strategies; you must only solve the last problem.
